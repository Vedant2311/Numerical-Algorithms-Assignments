# Numerical-Algorithms-Assignments

The directories here correspond to the four different Assignments of the course of COL726: Numerical Algorithms (Fall 2021) at IIT Delhi. A brief description of these Assignments corresponding to the different topics involved in them is given below:

- **A1**: Consists of theoretical questions regarding the topics of floating point arithmetic, backward and forward stability, and matrix norms. Analysed different ways of solving a recurrence relation and performed a stability of those methods of obtaining a solution.
- **A2**: Consists of theoretical questions from the topics of Projectors, SVD, QR-factorization, and Gram-Schmidt algorithm. Implemented the Modified GS algorithm to get the matrix for orthogonal polynomials and confirmed that with the Legendre polynomials.
